                                        </quote>, revealing this as one unit (with the Proper of Saints following directly after the Proper of Time). 
                                        The signatures on quire 26-27, 31-33, and 66 align with a series in which each quire signature is 2 less of the current number of quires, which would be explained if, for example, the current quires 1-3 were once one quire (1-3 = 1; 4 = 2; 5 = 3 etc.).
                                        At some point, the current quires 25-36 were inserted into the unit which consisted of the current quires 5-24 and 37-64, and new quire numbers applied. As only one folio of the last quire (66, signature <quote>64</quote>) remains, and the last folio of the inserted unit, <locus from="407v" to="407v" scheme="folios"/>, carries the donation note of Mathias Hendel, a likely scenario would seem to be that the current quires 25-36 originally made up the last part of the manuscript, with whatever came between the rest of what is now quire 66 and what is now quire 25 having been lost.

The original binding displays at least two contemporary layers: first, red leather over wooden boards. Over this, a second cover, of brown leather, has been added and is now glued down. The first layer of leather appears to cover a smaller area than the second, and the wooden board has been cracked in two and repaired. The two layers may correspond to the addition of several quires and reorganisation of the original structure which is revealed by the quire signatures. 5 double raised bands and endbands. Originally, two clasps and straps; centre and corner bosses. <locus from="Spine" to="Spine" scheme="other"/> (on red cover), in ink on a paper label: <quote>Missale 180</quote>; stamped in gold: <quote>A 175</quote>; in ink on a parchment label: <quote>No 45</quote>; in ink on a parchment label on top of the previous label: <quote>e. 30. 5. <supplied reason="damage">4</supplied>

Some of these may be later additions.
